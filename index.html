                    <label>I wanted this image to look like a concept art drawing with an emphasis on the brush and line work. 
                        For this effect, I used Photoshop to create a solid white layer on top of the original photo. 
                        Then I erased it to create texture and added additional brush marks in the background.</label>

               <img src="img/fall.jpg" alt="fall" width=415px height=585px>
               <label>I really love fall colors so I used various color filters to increase the saturation in this picture. 
                    To make the geometric shapes, I cut and pasted different layers using the selection tool.
                   Additionally, I used multiple blending modes in Photoshop to get a double exposure effect.</label>

                    <img src="img/nyc.jpg" alt="nyc" width=500px height=500px>
                    <label>For this picture, I wanted to capture my memory of when I visited New York City.
                        I used a stock image to frame the picture as if it was in an art museum and added a brick background.
                        I also manipulated the image in the frame using different blending modes and cutting out layers.</label>
